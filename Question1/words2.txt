The main reason why the lights have been so dazzling is because we are at a peak in the Sun's 11-year cycle of activity.

During this phase there is an increase in the number of eruptions from the Sun, including solar flares and coronal mass ejections.

These send powerful bursts of energy and material into space, causing - amongst other things - the aurora that we see from Earth.

The increase in eruptions is brought about by the Sun's magnetic poles flipping. On Earth that would be like the North and South Poles swapping places.

Originally the Sun's activity was expected to peak in the latter half of 2025 but scientists from NASA, 
the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency and the Solar Cycle Prediction Panel announced that the Sun reached its maximum in October 2024.

The last peak in the Sun's activity - known as the "solar maximum" - was around 2014.

Now technology has improved it means we have better forecasts, apps and social media to give us real-time information on solar activity.

A decade ago phone cameras had lower resolutions and fewer photographic features. Now, though, smartphones are capable of taking some stunning pictures
